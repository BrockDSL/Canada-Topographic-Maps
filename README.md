# How to find and download topographic maps of Canada

### Part A: Finding the map sheet of interest

1. Go to TOPORAMA [https://atlas.gc.ca/toporama/en/index.html](https://atlas.gc.ca/toporama/en/index.html)

2. In the search bar, enter "Niagara". The map zooms to the Niagara area.

3. Zoom in and out using the mouse scroll wheel. To pan the map, click and drag.

4. Click the red target beside "Get coordinates from map".

5. Click the map to see a pop-up of information including Geographic Coordinates, UTM
Coordinates, NTS Map sheet, UTM Elevation and Magnetic declination. 

> **Note the NTS map sheet number and name (i.e. 030M03 - NIAGARA)**

### Part B: Downloading maps and data

1. Expand the Toporama menu and click on the “Downloaded Maps and Data”

2. Click under *Raster Maps* “Get all maps for all of Canada”. This will bring you to the Open Government Portal web page. 

3. In the search box, enter "Digital Topographic Raster Maps"

OR

4. Click here directly [https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/d248b5be-5887-4cfb-942f-d425d82e6ea9/resource/9ca5525b-8527-40ec-9711-a2d744cf1ec0](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/d248b5be-5887-4cfb-942f-d425d82e6ea9/resource/9ca5525b-8527-40ec-9711-a2d744cf1ec0)

5. Click the URL to access the FTP directory for download. The number of the 50k map is 030M03. 

6. Click on the folder labeled 50k. Each click may take a few seconds to activate and load the FTP site.

7. Locate the folder with "030" and click it.

8. Find the folder with "m" and click it.

9. Find the folder with "03" and click it.

10. Rest the cursor over each file to see the filename at the bottom of the window and make an appropriate selection. For example, a filename ending with "prtrdy" will download a print ready PDF. If you can't see the file names, click each one to download and see the files. Look in your DOWNLOADS directory for the files.

 > HINT: the second file in the listing for 30M03 is the print-ready PDF.
